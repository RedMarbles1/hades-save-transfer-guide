# Hades Save Transfer Guide

A guide for transferring Hades saves from PC/Mac to iOS and also transferring them back.

# Please remove any mods and load your save file in vanilla at least once before attempting!!
This is to prevent any issues that can arise from mods. Please ensure that your saves work fully in vanilla before attempting this.

## What do you need

### Windows:
You'll need to have [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) installed.
And you'll need to find your save files, which should be in these locations depending on where you got the game from.

Steam/Epic Games: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Saved Games\Hades\
Microsoft Store: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\SupergiantGamesLLC.Hades_q53c1yqmx7pha\SystemAppData\wgs

### macOS:
You'll need to find your save files, which are located in $HOME/Library/Application Support/Supergiant Games/Hades/

## How to do it: 

1: Connect your device.

2: Open Finder/iTunes and navigate to the device menu from there. For Windows, click on the phone icon at the top and for macOS, click the phone/tablet icon with your device's name on the left.

3: Navigate to the file sharing/files menu.

4: From there, click on the arrow near Hades and then select the folder with the name "Hades".

5: Drag it out to a folder of your choosing.

6: Go into the folder then navigate to Supergiant Games > Hades > (Seemingly random string)

7: Copy your save files there. I'd recommend copying the whole folder to prevent any issues but copying the Profile[Slot].sav, Profile[Slot]_Temp.sav and Profile[Slot].sjson should be enough.

8: Return back to iTunes. 

9: Select the previously mentioned "Hades" folder and right click to delete it.

10: Copy the modified Hades folder back to your device by dragging it on top of the game's icon.

11: Open the game, and try to go into your save. If you are presented with a save conflict message, choose the local one.
